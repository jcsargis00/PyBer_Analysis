# PyBer_Analysis
### Background
This report has been prepared for V. Isualize to summarize data trends found in an in-depth
analysis of the multi-city PyBer ride sharing company city.  The analysis used city and 
ride data provided by PyBer.

Cities were categorized as urban, suburban or rural.
Fares were tracked by driver, city, average fare and total fare.

A summary follows the findings with recommendations to address disparites found amongst the differing city types.
### Analysis
#### Overview
Pandas functions were used to create a customized PyBer data frame.  From the data frame,
the total number of rides, total number of drivers and the total fares for each city type 
were found.  With this information, average fare per ride and average fare per driver 
for each city were calculated.
#### Results

The total rides for each city type were 125 (rural), 625 (suburban) and 1625 (urban).
